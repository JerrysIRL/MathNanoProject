# Assignment Name

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises related to 'Math' Course. The goal is to implement representations for State, Interpolation, Intersection, Collision, and Noise, and create a functional game loop using these implementations.


The repository is organized as follows:

- `exercise1/`: State
  - Guards with vision cone
  - Backstabbing

- `exercise2/`: Interpolation
  - Interpolating character rotation
  - Accelerating character movement
